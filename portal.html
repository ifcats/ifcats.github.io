  <h4>What is Patient Portal?</h4>
  <p>
    The Patient Portal is one of the many requirements mandated by the
    government in the move to electronic medical records (EMR). We use
    eClinicalWorks as our EMR vendor, and, as part of their service, they
    provide a patient portal, housed on their servers, which allows patients
    to access their own personal health information online. For more
    information, please visit

    .

  <h4>Logging in to Patient Portal</h4>
  <p>
    To access your patient portal, please give the receptionist your personal
    email address. Once your email address has been entered, eClinicalWorks
    will contact you, by email, with your login information. This patient
    portal transition is a work-in-progress for both our office, and
    eClinicalWorks, and we appreciate your input as we troubleshoot this new
    system.

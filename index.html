        <p>
          We are a small private Integrative Family practice. In the Springs
          wing of Clifton Springs Hospital and Clinic, we work closely with
          practices of massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, balneology and naturopathy.

        <h5 class="blurb-heading">Our Approach</h5>
        <p>
          It is our belief that practices that have survived the centuries have
          much to offer with conventional medical care. Our focus, not on
          disease, but on health and wellness, integrates the best that all of
          these practices have to offer.

      <div class="one-third column">
        <h5 class="blurb-heading">What We Do</h5>
        <p>
          We work with our patients so they have more control of the healthcare
          they receive. Diet, exercise, environmental modifications, and even
          pharmaceutical drugs are used to optimize health and minimize disease.

    <h4>IV Infusions Offered at IFCS</h4>
    <strong>Theoretical Basis for IV Therapy:</strong>
    <p>
      Absorption of nutrients taken orally can be impeded  by health conditions
      that  compromise the digestive system and by certain pharmaceutical
      products. By administering nutrients intravenously the  GI tract is
      bypassed and 100% of the nutrients are directly available in the blood supply
      to all the cells in the body.  Serum blood concentrations are achieved
      that cannot be obtained by oral administration. 
    </p>
    <strong>Myer’s Cocktail:</strong>
    <p>
      Originally developed over 40 years ago by John Myers, MD and later modified
      by Alan Gaby, MD the Myer’s cocktail contains a blend of vitamins and
      minerals designed to optimize health and promote wellness. The ingredients
      include: Magnesium, calcium, Vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 &amp; B12, selenium and
      Vitamin C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential health benefits include an increase in energy, improved mental
      clarity, overall sense of wellbeing, quicker recovery, improved mood and
      better health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research suggests that the Myer’s infusion can have potential health benefits
      for the following conditions: Migraines, asthma, fatigue, fibromyalgia,
      depression, cardiovascular disease, upper respiratory infections, allergies
      and narcotic withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recommended dosing is 1-2 infusions per week over 1-3 months to assist in
      specific health conditions. Myer’s infusions can be used preventatively,
      ie before traveling, cold/flu season or once a month for optimal health,
      and/or when dealing with a stressful life event.
    </p>
    <strong>IV Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):</strong>
    <p>
      Vitamin C has long been known for its positive effects on the immune system.
      Vitamin C works in over 300 pathways  in the human body;  as a powerful
      antioxidant; stimulating collagen synthesis;  and as a strong antihistamine.
      IV administration of vitamin C can achieve serum blood concentrations 100 times
      greater than oral administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential health benefits include reducing oxidative stress to the body,
      boosting the immune system, stronger connective tissues, prevention and
      treatment of scurvy, better wound healing and faster recovery from injury.
      Vitamin C may play an important role in the adjunct treatment of Cancer,
      lyme disease, cardiovascular disease, cold/flu,  and Crohn’s disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recommend dosing is 25-50 grams per infusion and frequency is specific to
      health condition. High-dose vitamin C administration in combination with
      chemotherapy and radiation significantly improves the effectiveness of
      these treatments. [1]Vitamin C also lowers inflammation.[2,3] High doses
      of vitamin C help kill and eliminate colorectal cancer cells with certain
      genetic mutations. [4] Other studies[5] have shown high-dose vitamin C
      can help slow the growth of prostate, pancreatic, liver and colon cancer
      cells. IV vitamin C can also help improve symptoms associated with cancer
      and cancer treatment, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain, loss of appetite
      and overall quality of life.

    <strong>IV Glutathione:</strong>
    <p>
      Known as the mother of all antioxidants, some would say it’s the most important
      molecule your body needs to stay healthy and prevent disease. The good news is
      that your body makes its own glutathione but the bad news is that poor diet,
      environmental exposures, medications, stress, trauma, infections and aging all
      deplete it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential health benefits include slowing of aging, support of phase 2 liver
      detoxification, immune support, and reduced oxidative stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research suggests glutathione may help in the following conditions: Cancer,
      heart disease, dementia, Alzheimers, chronic fatigue, diabetes, arthritis,
      kidney disease, and liver disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recommended dose is 2000mg 1-3 times per week for 1-3 months depending on
      specific health conditions.

  <h4>Visit Policy</h4>
  <p>
    Each time you come to the office, you must bring with you your current
    insurance card and show it to our receptionist upon arrival. This is
    required by your insurance company. Our receptionists are extremely busy,
    and are doing their best to address all your needs. Please be respectful
    of them, as well as the other people in the office. As such, do not wear
    strong scents on your person, and do not use cell phones or be
    obstreperous. Your experience at our facility should be calm and peaceful.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Dr. Coan's role as faculty at the University of Rochester, she
    frequently has medical students and residents shadowing her. It is her
    belief that influencing the acceptance of integrative practice into
    conventional medicine is best done through teaching future generations of
    physicians. We appreciate your help in this teaching process, and therefore
    may ask you to let a student or resident be involved in your visit. You,
    of course, have the option to refuse.
  </p>
  <h4>No-Show Policy</h4>
  <p>
    Our schedules are booked to allow for sufficient patient time, thus we
    must keep our schedules full. If you do not show for your appointment, and
    do not give us at least 24-hours advanced notice to find a replacement, we
    will charge a $25 fee. Please note that even with this, our office loses
    money when you do not show for your scheduled appointment. If you miss
    three or more appointments without providing advanced notice, your
    appointments may be double booked, and you will have a shorter
    appointment time. If you continue to miss your appointments, you may be
    asked to leave the practice.
  </p>
  <h4>Late Policy</h4>
  <p>
    If you arrive late for your appointment, you may be asked to reschedule or
    wait until the provider can see you without furthur disrupting the patient
    schedule. Dr. Coan is willing to have you call ahead to see how late she
    is running, and adjust your time appropriately.
  </p>
  <h4>No CoPay Policy</h4>
  <p>
		Due to the expenses of having a billing service, when you do not present
    your copay at the time of your visit, we are charged a $30 processing fee
    to obtain your copay. This charge will be passed on to you.
  </p>
  <h4>Message Policy</h4>
  <p>
		When you call the office, please be patient and remember that Michelle is
    only one person and is trying to answer telephones, check people in and
    out, and message everyone else in the office. We may not be able to
    respond to your requests before the end of the business day. When you agree
    to use the patient portal, you will be able to message the office directly,
    without the time constraint of office hours. Dr. Coan is frequently
    reviewing labs and documents in the evenings and on weekends, and will get
    back to you as soon as she able.

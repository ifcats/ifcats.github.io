          Dr. Coan is Board Certified in Family Medicine and Integrative
          Medicine. She has been practicing integrative medicine since 2000.
          Her prior experience working in both the chemical
          and pharmaceutical industries has significantly influenced her
          practice of medicine. Not confined to the conventional medical
          paradigm, she believes that the best medicine is an integration of
          the best that all practices have to offer.
